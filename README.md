# Skór

*Skór* means shoes in Icelandic.

## Exercise 1

Submission for this exercise includes the following files:

- `00_exploring_data.ipynb` – initial exploratory analysis
- `01_prepare_data.ipynb` – manual data transformation
- `02_data_pipeline_refactored.ipynb` – refactored code, modeling, and analysis (if I had to submit only one notebook this would be it)
- `Accompanying Notes.pdf` – notes that have important analysis and explanations about how I processed the variables and proceeded with training

The notebooks above have metadata and outputs stripped for more convenient diff display when committing using Git, if you'd like to have a look at the rendered outputs, please look in the folder:

- `PDF notebooks` that has all three notebooks with outputs rendered (beware that the first to have long output pages, the last one has no long outputs).
